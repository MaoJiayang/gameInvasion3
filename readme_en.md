# GameInvasion
This project is a homework for one of my courses.
A pure Python game, the teacher's original intention was "Alien Invasion" but I think this name is too ugly ()
The purpose of this project is to learn and write a game engine based on pure Python, and develop a game based on this engine.

## Installation
Please make sure your Python version is greater than 3.9
### Install from source
To install this project, you can run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MaoJiayang/gameInvasion3
# Switch to the project directory
cd gameInvasion3
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or download the code zip package and run locally:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the project, you can enter the project directory and run develop_main.py
### Install from pip
Of course, if you just want to play my game demo, you can also:
```bash
# Download my project
pip install gameInvasion3
# Run the executable file
gameInvasion3
```
## Project structure
### invasionEngine: the game engine itself
It includes the basic game engine organization structure of components-game objects-scenes. It also includes some constant definitions and game event definitions. Generally speaking, there is no need to modify the code in it when just using this project.
### invasion_game_demo:
This is the game demo
